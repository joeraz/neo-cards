# Neo Cards
Neo Cards is a collection of PNG format playing card images for use in various games.  Most of the images are based on modified versions of public domain/CC0 graphics, and have been modified to all be a universal size and style, for easy use and playability.  In addition to the standard 52-card deck with a joker, I also have a full set of cards for a Tarock deck, and I included variations on the typical cards, allowing you to mix and match to form your own unique decks.

A full list of sources can be found in credits.txt.

These images were originally created for PySol Fan Club Edition and a card game app that I am currently developing, but I have decided to release these images for public use under a CC-BY-SA license.  Enjoy!
